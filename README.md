## Inspiration
The HPCC challenge inspired us to tackle a new system and try and take a creative spin on the challenge. Interactive maps are always super fun to mess around with and can display a lot of different data so it was a perfect way to present the data we were given.

## What It Does
Tropical Bliss is a service that requires the user to provide simple answers to some questions about the importance of education, health, crime, and climate on their living location decision making. Tropical Bliss then takes the users input and scores each state based on these answers. The less important a cateogory is to a user, the less that category affects the overall score of the state.

## How We Built It
We utilized the given datasets and ECL to extract useful data into .csv files to generate our "database." This database was then used in our back-end to collect and process user data. We utilized python with flask for the back-end and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for our front-end.

## Challenges We Ran Into
ECL was a challenge to get working with and we were not able to get it directly integrated into our web app. Additionally, some parts of getting the web app working such as form post requests and the interactive map script were a challenge due to the lack of experience in these areas on our team.

## Accomplishments
For the 24 hours we took to write this project, we are very proud of the bugs we overcame, things we learned, and solutions we came up with!

## What We Learned
Planning and design is everything. We all started experimenting with different parts of the project and quickly realized if we didn't make a plan, the different parts would not integrate well together. Additionally, we learned lots of new stuff such as ECL, POST requests, HTML, and more!

## What's Next
Tropical Bliss could use some major data upgrades. While the data we extracted is nice for the limited questions our survey has, the data has much more to offer as it stands and tens of other data points could be added to improve the survey and dataset the app is utilizing.
